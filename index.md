### CPSC 120


* Lab 7
As a person who enjoys knowing how things work, creating a blackjack game in Part 2 was very fun for me. Being able to use my newly learned skills in different functions and files allowed me to grasp a great understanding of the logistics behind simple online games. In this lab, I learned how to code defensively and create error messages for invalid user input.

* Lab 8
Part 2 in Lab 8 was probably my favorite lab, as constructing a looping pattern was very satisfying to create. In this lab, I was able to learn and grasp the idea of for-loops as I had the help of a visual representation. This lab was also very enjoyable because debugging errors was a lot easier. After all, I was able to visually see my mistakes in the picture.

* Lab 10
Simulating a real-life problem in Part 1 was very interesting because real statistics were used. I had fun reading and accessing a chart for the first time with this lab, and the implementation of a real-life scenario made it even more fun. In this lab, we learned how to access and use 2D vectors using multiple for-loops.
